# Mirage42 — Backlog

Everything we might work on. Add freely. I pull from here into today.md.
Mark items [done] when finished so they drop out of the active list.

## Active

### FEATURE 1 — New-user onboarding + non-empty first feed
- Progress: T1 backend done (commit 9e51af4); T2 wizard UI done — OnboardingWizard component, apiService additions, FeedPage "Suggested for you" label, 12 new tests, browser-verified at 390px and 1280px.
- Fix: T13 — finish-profile step gated to Google-login users only + built-in selects, commit 1129e11.
- What: A new user (register form OR Google OAuth) currently lands on an empty feed (follows nobody) and gets no guidance. Build the real-app first-run experience: (1) a non-empty feed for users with zero follows — show popular/trending public posts labeled "Suggested for you" so the first screen is never blank; (2) a post-registration onboarding wizard shown once, as ordered steps with Skip / Back / Next / Done: **Step 1 — Pick interests** (select from the existing post categories; multi-select chips), **Step 2 — Suggested people to follow** (real users, searchable, follow inline), **Step 3 — Finish your profile** (only if `isProfileIncomplete`, prefilled, inline edit). Skipping any step is allowed and lands on the (now non-empty) feed; completing sets `onboardingComplete`.
- Reference: Instagram / X / LinkedIn first-run — interests picker, "suggested to follow" with one-tap follow, cold-start feed seeded with popular content. Wizard pattern like LinkedIn signup steps.
- States: each step has loading (skeleton user/category rows), empty ("No suggestions yet — search to find people"), error (retry), and a disabled/looping state on Next while saving. Feed cold-start has its own labeled section + empty fallback if even popular posts are zero.
- Entry points: shown automatically on first authenticated render when `onboardingComplete` is false, for BOTH the form-register redirect and the Google `?token=` landing. Reachable again later from settings? (defer — onboarding is one-time.)
- Data/API: add `User.onboardingComplete: Boolean` (default false) and `User.interests: [String]`; `PATCH /users/me/onboarding` to set interests + mark complete; `GET /users/suggested?limit=&cursor=` returning real users to follow (exclude self + already-following + blocked-either-way, prefer friends-of-friends then popular-by-followers), follow-state included; `getFeedCards` gains a popular-posts fallback (most-liked/most-recent active public posts, block-aware, paginated) when the viewer's visible following set is empty — labeled distinctly so the client can show "Suggested for you".
- Permissions/security: server-side — `PATCH /users/me/onboarding` only mutates the caller; suggested + popular queries are block-aware both directions; never expose private fields. Agents-as-users: an agent account hitting the same endpoints is fine (one code path).
- Responsive: 390px — full-screen single-column wizard, sticky bottom action bar (Skip left, Back/Next right), category chips wrap, suggested-user rows full width. 1280px — centered card (max ~560px) over a dimmed backdrop, same steps, action bar inside the card. Cold-start feed identical layout to normal feed, just a "Suggested for you" header.
- A11y: stepper is keyboard navigable, focus moves to step heading on change, chips are toggle buttons with aria-pressed, Next/Skip ≥44px, reduced-motion respected.
- Done-when: a brand-new account (both register paths) sees the wizard once; can skip straight through to a feed that shows popular posts (not blank); can pick interests + follow ≥1 suggested user + finish profile and land on a feed including those follows; re-login does NOT show the wizard again; correct at 390px and 1280px.

### Infrastructure hardening (deployment task — do with Render staging/production)
- What: Add network-level protection at the host: firewall rules, DDoS/WAF protection (e.g. Cloudflare in front), restrict inbound to required ports, lock down Atlas network access to known IPs.
- Type: infrastructure (not a code task — done at deploy time, verified in the host dashboards)
- Reference: none
- Notes: app-level defenses (rate limiting, validation, helmet headers, XSS/CSRF) live in CLAUDE.md standards; THIS item is the network/infra layer that sits outside the app code.

### Infinite scroll across list pages
- What: Replace "load more" buttons with auto-loading infinite scroll (e.g. 30 posts, then 30 more on scroll) with a loading spinner, on all list pages — feed, profiles, all users, all posts.
- Type: phase-d (collides with planned cursor pagination)
- Reference: none
- Notes: DO NOT build ad-hoc. This is the same work as Phase D cursor pagination — belongs there to avoid building it twice.

### Vercel preview URLs blocked by backend CORS
- What: Vercel preview deployments get a unique, per-deploy hostname that isn't in the API's CORS allowlist, so the preview frontend can't call the backend (requests fail CORS).
- Type: infrastructure / config
- Reference: none
- Notes: needs the API CORS origin check to also allow Vercel preview hostnames (e.g. match the `*.vercel.app` preview pattern / per-branch URLs) instead of only the fixed production origin. Keep on Active.

### TASK B — Messaging stops after a long session  [BACKLOG ONLY — DO NOT BUILD THIS RUN]
- Type: bug → diagnose-only, handled in a separate session
- Symptom: After a long logged-in session the user can't send DMs; sends silently fail until logout + relogin. Likely token expiry interacting with the socket/auth layer.
- Notes: Queued investigation task. Do not implement now; handled in a separate session.

## Awaiting review

## Done

(finished items move here, newest on top)

### FEATURE 5 — Fullscreen, zoomable chat images — DONE
- Merged to main as 4eb907f (T12). Chat image messages open in a fullscreen viewer with gradual scroll/pinch/double-tap zoom + pan (reused ZoomableImage), from both full chat and the dock; closes via X/backdrop/Esc.

### FEATURE 4 — Block user from the chat 3-dot menu — DONE
- Merged to main as 4ba5fbe (T11). "Block user" added to the chat overflow ⋯ menu in both ChatHeader and DockedChatWindow (new ⋯ for the dock); confirm → block → conversation closes and leaves the list/dock.

### FEATURE 3 — Likes-count modal + report-a-post (+ admin) — DONE
- Merged to main across T6–T10 (likes endpoint 9ee316f, likes modal fca64f9, report backend 1dc213d, report UI 4994277, admin reports 49bf7be). Clickable "N likes" → paginated likers modal with follow state; report-a-post with reason picker + dedupe; admin Reports column + reporter list + admin notification.

### FEATURE 2 — Smarter notifications — DONE
- Merged to main across T3–T5 (delete-bug + comment copy 1ace22b, deep-link + comment anchor 0640575, notification settings ef90715). Trash deletes without navigating; "commented on your post" copy; like/comment notifs deep-link to the post; reply/comment-like notifs scroll to + highlight the comment; per-type notification settings gate creation server-side.

### TASK A — External share OG/Twitter preview route — DONE
- Merged to main as f2db9fc (public GET /s/card/:id serves post-specific OG + Twitter tags with image c_fill / video so_0 poster, then redirects humans to the SPA card). Real WhatsApp/LinkedIn crawler rendering remains a staging acceptance gate (localhost is crawler-unreachable).

### TASK D — Share dialog recent-contacts default list — DONE
- Merged to main as 52e510e (new GET /users/recent-contacts; share dialog shows up to 10 recent DM contacts on open, typing searches all users, clearing restores; block-aware, owner-only).

### TASK C — Video poster in shared card — DONE
- Merged to main as 1fd99cd (server-built sharedCard.posterUrl = Cloudinary so_0 frame for Cloudinary videos; non-Cloudinary videos use a seeked muted <video> first-frame instead of a black box).

### Blocked accounts management screen — DONE
- Merged to main as 7564f73 (Blocked settings tab + BlockedUsersSection backed by GET /users/blocked; resolves the post-reload unblock dead-end).

### Chat dock (LinkedIn-style) — DONE
- Merged to main as 9f54ba8, reworked in d1a5542 (persistent bottom-right Messaging bar listing all conversations with presence dots + one larger chat window that swaps on open; hidden on /chat and on mobile).

### LinkedIn-style suggested/mutual friends modals — DONE
- Merged to main as 7d558a0 (reusable PeopleModal with scroll-pagination from the feed sidebar + profile mutual/suggested panels; just-followed person lingers ~5s in suggested mode).

### Mobile friends-suggestions between posts — DONE
- Merged to main as 1ad3aa8 (mobile "People you may know" carousel after the 3rd feed post + See all modal; hidden on desktop).

### Block user — DONE
- Merged to main as 53b7138, hardened in 7564f73 (server-enforced block both directions across lists/profile/feed/messaging/follow + posts & comments via getHiddenUserIds/stripBlockedComments; locked-profile placeholder reachable only from the Blocked list).
- Hardening pass (branch autopilot/2026-06-29, awaiting review): closed 3 residual gaps — (A) getChats() now drops conversations with a blocked counterpart so the stale DM thread leaves the chat list + dock; (B) comment-like / comment-reply notifications are suppressed across a block (third-party comment-author case); (C) like/comment WRITE endpoints now 403 a blocked actor (read already 404'd). Tests: apps/api/tests/block-hardening.test.js. UX polish (confirm dialog, ⋯ menu on user cards, undo snackbar) and report-user deliberately deferred.

### Share a post — DONE
- Merged to main as c549524, rebuilt to real-app standard in ac13700 (server-search recipient picker, auto-close on send, clickable rich sharedCard card in chat that opens the post; external Web Share + copy-link kept).

### Comment-on-comment / subcomments — DONE
- Merged to main as 5e18438 (single-level Instagram/YouTube-style replies + 'comment-reply' notification to the comment author).

### "Add post" on own profile — DONE
- Merged to main as 80a156c, spacing fix 7410593 (owner-gated CreateCard composer on the profile tab, with a top gap matching the rest of the page).

### Image zoom in post modal — DONE
- Merged to main as fa4ef71, gradual-zoom fix fb14a8d (pinch/scroll/double-click zoom + drag-pan; wheel step lowered so zoom climbs gradually to ~4x and clamps, zoom-out clamps at fit).

### Auto-play video on scroll into view — DONE
- Merged to main as c3034da (feed videos auto-play muted when ≥60% visible, pause on scroll away, via the existing VideoCoordinator).

### Notify author when their post is removed/banned — DONE
- Merged to main as a80708e ('post-removed' notification to the author on ban, gavel icon, moderator identity hidden).

### Sticky left sidebar on scroll (desktop) — DONE
- Merged to main as 13d9e9c (feed left column position:sticky on desktop; mobile unchanged).

### Like a comment — DONE
- Merged to main as 53a7cb8 (heart like toggle + count per comment; 'comment-like' notification to the comment author).

### Online/offline status dot on users — DONE
- Merged to main as 7173d5e (green/grey presence dot on user + chat avatars via a minimal Socket.io presence layer).

### Multi-step register form — DONE
- Merged to main via PR #1 (3-step MUI Stepper: Account / About you / Location; dropped phone/job/about-me; phone+lastName optional in the shared user-validation API; form password rule aligned to the API's strong rule; button-gap below step fields fixed).

### Video/media in public profile + rename to "media" — DONE
- Merged to main as 798e439 (videos render in the profile media grid; "Photos" → "Media").

### Mobile video posts won't open as modal — DONE
- Merged to main as a0ae628 (transparent tap overlay over feed videos opens the modal on mobile).

### Posts uniform height in feed — DONE
- Shipped: feed media keeps natural aspect ratio with a max-height 600px cap; over-tall media cropped from the top. In CardItem.
- Merged to main as b63773e.
